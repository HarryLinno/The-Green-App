    //"nextRound()" is a function that, when called upon, will update the text in "lblScore" with the the value of variable "score" and also set the image property of "imgItem" to a random image, selected from the array "items".

        lblScore.text = String(score)

    //"btnReset" is an action that, when activated, will set the value of "score" to 0 in order to reset the user's score, and activates the "nextRound()" function to effectively reset the entire text. Text will then appear in "lblFeedback", telling the user that the game has been reset.
    @IBAction func btnReset(_ sender: UIButton) {
        score = 0
        nextRound()
        lblFeedback.text = "The game has been reset. Have fun!"
    }
    //"btnStart" is an action that, when activated, will start the game. "btnStart" is the only button that is enabled when the user loads into the view, and will also activate "btnYellow", "btnRed", "btnGreen", "btnReset" when it is activated. It will deactivate itself after being pressed as it will no longer be useful, and also to avoid the need for error messages. "btnStart" will set "score" to 0 (even if "score" was already 0, just to be sure), and will call the function "nextRound()" while also updating the text in "lblFeedback" with a prompt and instructions for the game.
    @IBAction func btnStart(_ sender: UIButton) {
        btnYellow.isEnabled = true
        btnRed.isEnabled = true

        lblFeedback.text = "In which bin would you put the displayed item? Tap a bin to select it."
    }
    //"btnYellow" is initally disabled when the user loads into the view for the first time, but is reactivated after "btnStart" is activated. When "btnYellow" is selected, it will check the image currently set in "imgItem" through a switch statement, checking to see if the image matches any of the images listed in the cases. If the user was correct in selecting the yellow bin (eg. picking the yellow bin for "BeerCan"), the text in "lblFeedback" is updated with text telling the user they are correct, while 10 is added to the value of "score". The function "nextRound()" is then activated. If the user makes a minorly incorrect choice (eg. picking the yellow bin for "Cheeseburger"), the text in "lblFeedback" is updated, telling the user they have made an error and gives them either the correct answer or a description of why they're wrong. The value of "score" is subtracted by 1, and then the function "nextRound()" is called. If the user makes a very incorrect answer (eg. picking the yellow bin for "DeadFlowers"), the text of "lblFeedback" is updated with a description of their mistake, the value of "score" is subtracted by 5 and "nextRound()" is called. Since it is impossible for the user to be given an image that isn't part of the switch statement, the need for an error message is diminished. This description also applies to "btnRed" and "btnGreen".
