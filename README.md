# The-Green-App
An iOS application written in Swift.

"The Green App" is an application centred around informing users of their ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT. Key aspects of this application
are tailored towards AUSTRALIAN USERS, so if you wish to use some of the ideas from this project, you may want to keep that
in consideration.

Please note that this application is part of a SCHOOL PROJECT.
